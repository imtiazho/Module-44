Single Page Applcation
1. Single-page applications are the most popular way to create websites that load faster without    hitting the server every time the user interacts with the application.
2. The major difference between multi-page and single-page applications is that single-page apps download the page a single time once it is executed.
3. As soon as a user interacts with the app, only the required component will be modified, not the complete application.
4. An important feature of single-page applications is performance.
